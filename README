Building for Windows
====================
God help you.  Give up now. 

These are instructions if you ever need to build the spaceport publishing executable
First download ruby for windows:
http://rubyinstaller.org/
Then download the ruby devkit.  This is for building gems that have a native component ( like the json gem ):
http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/

Then do this.  You must do this on a windows machine:
gem install ocra
remove entire development section from gemfile
ocra --add-all-core --gemfile Gemfile --gem-full --output spaceport-publishing.exe bin/spaceport
