To generate / update the bundle just run:

ruby sp_bundle.rb sp_bundle.config . ../

The sp_bundle.config file is where you specify which files should be bundled using paths that are relative to the game directory

The arguments to the ruby command are:
  1: path to the sp_bundle.rb command
  2: path to sp_bundle.config
  3: path to the root folder of your Spaceport game (where your game's main .html file is)
  4: path to the directory in which you would like to place the "built_client" directory
        where the files are grouped before import into Xcode.  Do not check "built_client" into version control.

If for some reason you just want to regenerate the manifest.xml but not update the bundle, you can just run:

ruby sp_generate_manifest.rb sp_bundle.config .

This also has the benefit of showing you the total filesize of all the assets in the built_client directory (the size of the bundled assets)

To bundle the assets into your app.  Just drag the contents of the "built_client" folder (not the folder itself) to the "Bundled_Assets" folder in Xcode.  

You will then see an options dialog appear.  Ensure the following settings are correct:

- "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" is UNCHECKED
- "Create folder references for any added folders" is SELECTED
- All targets are SELECTED

Be sure to do a clean build whenever files are REMOVED from the bundle.
