# To generate / update the bundle just run

cd game
ruby ../scripts/bundle.rb ../scripts/bundle.config . ../

# The scripts/bundle.config file is where you specify which files should be bundled using paths that are relative to the game directory

# The arguments to the bundle.rb command are:
#    1: path to bundle.config
#    2: path to the root foler ("game" in your case)
#    3: path to the directory in which you would like to place the "bundled files" (a directory full of files for use with X-Code bundling)


# When you run bundle.rb it will generate a built_client directory.  
# This should NOT be checked into version control and should probably be svn ignored
# I just don't know how to use SVN

# If for some reason you just want to regen the manifest.xml but not update the bundle, you can run

cd game
ruby ../scripts/generate_manifest.rb ../scripts/bundle.config .

# This also has the benefit of showing you the total filesize of all the assets in the built_client directory (the size of the bundled assets)
